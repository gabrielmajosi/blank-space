A demo for SvelteKit and Express. 

## Running
1. Run `npm i` in both `frontend` and `backend` folders
2. `cd frontend/`
3. `npm run build` or `pnpm build`
4. Use something like `forever` to run both apps as a daemon
5. Start both servers `forever start backend/app.js` & `forever start rontend/build/index.js`
